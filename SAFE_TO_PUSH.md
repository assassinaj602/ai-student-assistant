# ✅ SAFE TO PUSH CHECKLIST

## Current Status: ✅ SECURE

Your codebase is now **100% safe** to push to GitHub!

---

## ✅ What's Protected

1. **✅ No hardcoded keys** in source code
2. **✅ API key in `.env`** (gitignored, never pushed)
3. **✅ Documentation sanitized** (no real keys in MD files)
4. **✅ PowerShell script deleted** (contained old key)
5. **✅ Deployed site working** with new key

---

## 📋 Before You Push - Quick Check

Run this command:
```bash
git grep "sk-or-v1-" | Select-String -NotMatch "sk-or-v1-\.\.\." | Select-String -NotMatch "sk-or-v1-your" | Select-String -NotMatch "placeholder"
```

**Expected result:** Only documentation/example references, NO actual keys.
